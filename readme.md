Droo's Practice Blog

## Getting Started

Install MAMP (Mac) or XAMPP (Windows)
Start local server (MAMP or XAMPP)
Go to wordpress.org and download the most recent version of WordPress
Go to ‘localhost’ in a web browser while your MAMP or XAMPP server is running to view your newly created ‘wordpress’ and ‘project’ site folder projects
Click on your newly created project folder and follow the prompt to create your wp-config.php file
Go to the start page for MAMP or XAMPP and go to the phpMyAdmin portal.
Click on the database tab and create a new database which you can name the same as your project
Go back to your web browser to finish setting up WordPress locally and enter in the database name you just created. Since we are working locally you can use ‘root’ for the database username and password.
Run the install
Enter a site title, username, and password and uncheck private so search engines do not index your site. This username and password is what you will use to login to localhost/projectname/wp-admin
Click install WordPress and login to your newly created, locally hosted WordPress site!
